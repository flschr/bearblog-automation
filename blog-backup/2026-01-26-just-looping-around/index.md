<video loop muted playsinline autoplay preload="none" width="100%">
  <source src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/fischr/img_8986.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

This looped video looks fun, but the workflow is not ideal. It started with a Live Photo on my iPhone, which I converted to WEBM before uploading it to the Bear Blog media gallery. All just to prove that Bear Blog can play uploaded videos (as long as they stay below 3 MB). 

Looping luckily can be achieved with the embed code.

```HTML
<video loop muted playsinline autoplay preload="none" width="100%">
 <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
```

I need to figure out a smoother way to achieve this.
