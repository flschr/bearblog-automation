# Excluded domains for link checking
# Add one domain per line (without http://)
# Both domain and all subdomains will be excluded
# Example: wikipedia.org excludes de.wikipedia.org, en.wikipedia.org, etc.
#
# Note: You don't need to add both "example.com" and "www.example.com"
# Just add "example.com" and www.example.com will also be excluded
#
# To exclude specific sites temporarily (e.g., during maintenance):
# 1. Add the domain here
# 2. Run the link checker again
# 3. Remove the domain when ready to check again

# Sites with aggressive rate limiting
